# Privacy policy

The app runs entirely locally, on your iOS device. It does not need a network connection. 
    
The app does not collect any data, period. 

The user can access any file locally accessible on the system.

During the TestFlight phase, if the application crashes, a crash report can be sent to the developers. This crash report will contain information about what caused the crash (functions being called, values of variables). 

The owner of the application, [Hans Sch√ºlein](mailto:contact.kamik423@gmail.com), does not have any way to access the data viewed or created by the user.
